<h1> About </h1>

<p>This website was created to serve as a database that provides people the ability to find sites of Arab culture. These sites vary from cultural institutions to grocery stores. Together, the sites weave a network of the Arab-American community of New York, that can otherwise be hard to find direct information about. Arab Americans initially found their place in New York city during the late 1800s to the early 1900s. So much so that part of what is now the financial district, used to be called “Little Syria”. These days, the Arab community has been pushed into further areas like Astoira, Queens and Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Considering that the history of Arab Americans and their culture in the city has been harder to find, as communities shift to these neighborhood pockets, finding these cultural sites can feel hard. <br><br>

I started taking note of all the places I’d go to that reminded me of home, and eventually I made this website as a response to seeing how this notes list can move to something that is more user friendly and experiential through the visual of a map.
